## Text Feature Engineering and Text Analysis using Machine learning algorithms

This text analysis project utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) involved the following key aspects:

* Utilized NLTK library to generate techniques to analyze and process textual data.
* Applied methods such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
* Developed and implemented sentiment analysis models to determine the sentiment of text.
* Extracted relevant information and performed topic modeling to identify key themes.
* Built machine learning models for text classification or text generation tasks.
* Evaluated and fine-tuned the performance of NLP models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
* Leveraged libraries and frameworks such as NLTK, SpaCy, TensorFlow for efficient text analysis.
* Produced meaningful insights and actionable recommendations based on the results of the text analysis project.

I have performed both Text Feature Engineering and Text Analysis in this project.

#### Text Feature Engineering 
- Transformed raw text data into a format that can be used for machine learning algorithms 
- Extracting relevant features or characteristics from text data and representing them in a numerical or categorical format that can be used as input for machine learning models
-  Methods: Tokenization, Word Embedding, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), N-Grams, and Sentiment Analysis.

Text feature engineering is done to prepare the data for analysis by transforming it into a suitable representation.

#### Text Analysis 
- Extract meaningful insights and information from text data 
- Techniques and approaches for understanding and interpreting text 
- Topic Modeling (LDA), Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Information Extraction, Text Summarization, and Text Clustering

Text analysis, in this project, encompasses various methods and techniques for gaining insights and understanding from the processed input text data.

#### The tech stack for this project: 

  ##### Programming Languages: 
    Python: NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
    
  ##### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:
    NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A popular library for NLP tasks, including tokenization, stemming, POS tagging, and more.
    spaCy: A powerful NLP library for text processing, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
    Gensim: A library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis.
    Transformers: A library by Hugging Face that provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for various NLP tasks.

  ##### Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries:
    Scikit-Learn: A versatile library for machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering.
    TensorFlow: An open-source deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
    Keras: A high-level neural networks API that can be used on top of TensorFlow for faster model prototyping.

  ##### Text Processing Tools:
    Tokenizers: Libraries or modules for text tokenization, such as NLTK's tokenizer or spaCy's tokenizer.
    Word Embeddings: Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or fastText for representing words as numerical vectors.
    TF-IDF: A numerical representation technique that measures the importance of words in a document corpus.

  ##### Data Storage and Manipulation:
    Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for handling structured data, including text data.
    SQLite: Relational databases for storing and managing text data.

  ##### Visualization and Reporting:
    Matplotlib: A popular data visualization library for creating plots, charts, and graphs.
    Seaborn: A higher-level data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

#### Machine Learning Models Utilized:
     1. K-medoids is a clustering algorithm that aims to partition a given dataset into K clusters. It is a variation of the K-means algorithm that uses representative objects called medoids instead of centroids.
     
     2. LDA stands for Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and it is a popular topic modeling algorithm used in natural language processing (NLP). 
     
     3. Word ranking is natural language processing (NLP) algorithm that involves assigning scores or ranks to words based on their importance or relevance within a given context. The purpose of word ranking is to identify key terms or keywords that carry significant meaning or represent important concepts in a text or corpus.
